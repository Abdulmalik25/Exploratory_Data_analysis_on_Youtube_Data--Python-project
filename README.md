# Exploratory_Data_analysis_on_Youtube_Data-Python-project
Welcome to my exploratory journey into YouTube's enigmatic data! ðŸŒŸ As YouTube decided to hide dislike counts, our project takes a closer look at the last glimpse of this data before it disappeared in Dec 2021. Using Python's powerful libraries, Pandas and NumPy, we're unpacking secrets that were once visible to all.

# Domain: Social Media

### Context and Content
In November 2021, YouTube announced its decision to hide dislike counts. However, until December 13, 2021, the official YouTube Data API provided access to dislike information. This project aims to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden insights from this dataset.

## Learning Outcome
- Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas.

## Objective
The objective is to analyze the YouTube dislikes dataset using NumPy and Pandas libraries, deriving meaningful insights through EDA.

## Dataset Description

## Overview
- This dataset provides insights into trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021 in the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.
- It contains information on dislikes, likes, views, and more, collected just before December 13, 2021.
- The data covers videos that had been trending in the mentioned countries for a year prior to the collection date.
